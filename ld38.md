ＦＩＳＨＷＯＲＬＤ is a fishing game!

### Story ###
You left your home colony and purchased your own tiny planet so you could do what you've always wanted to do: Start a sushi restaurant. You accept only a few customers per day and go out and catch the fish yourself. You will have to make sure you don't over-fish your tiny little planet, otherwise you'll not be able to fulfill orders.

### Gameplay ###

    * Note: **You can only carry 3 fish before returning to your restaurant for storage**
